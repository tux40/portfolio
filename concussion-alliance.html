                This was a three person team project. Our client was Malayka
                Gormally who is the co-founder of “Concussion Alliance”. We had
                three weeks to conduct interviews, gather data, create
                wireframes and high fidelity mockups and deliver a presentation.

                I was the visual designer for this project. This means that I

                style guide based on the original website as well as the new
                design, and redesigned portions of the new website based on user
