                The goal of this project was to redesign a section of the
                “Elliott Bay Book Store” based on user needs. This was an
                individual project however I did have a classmate who helped
                take notes when interviewing real users at the bookstore. I had
                two weeks to complete the task.

                I chose Daniella after visiting “Elliott Bay” and getting a feel
                for the demographic that shopped at their book store. After
                observing customers, talking to staff members, and interviewing
                users, I discovered that there is a wide range of people that
                shop at the bookstore. So I decided to dig into the website and
                see what the major UX issues were. What I discovered was that
                the website was hard to navigate and that the global navigation
                was unclearly labeled. Furthermore, the book category list was
                overwhelmingly long. This information lead me to choose Daniella
                as my target user. Some of her major needs include a simple
                layout with clear choices, suggestions based on past purchases,
                a simple checkout, and having a person to contact for help.

                Daniella is buying a fantasy book for her teenage grandson’s
                birthday. She likes Elliott Bay Book Company because she enjoys
                supporting local shops. She opens the home page and is
                immediately confused by the page’s layout and poor navigation.
                She tries to search for genres using the search bar but gets
                stuck in a loop of searching for keywords and receiving
                unrelated book titles. She eventually discovers the “Shop”
                button is a link that will take her to a “Browse Books” section
                button but she is met with a list of 52 subjects and unrelated
                books. When she tries to refine her search, she is again
                overwhelmed by the number of book categories she must sort
                through to find the right subject and book. This leads to
                frustration and early website abandonment.
